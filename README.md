Rotation-Robust Descriptors and Orthographic Views for Local Feature Matching

> [Project Page](https://uditsinghparihar.github.io/RoRD/)

## Abstract
We present a novel framework that combines learning of invariant descriptors through data augmentation and orthographic viewpoint projection. We propose *rotation-robust* local descriptors, learnt through training data augmentation based on rotation homographies, and a *correspondence ensemble* technique that combines vanilla feature correspondences with those obtained through rotation-robust features. Using a range of benchmark datasets as well as contributing a new bespoke dataset for this research domain, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on key tasks including pose estimation and visual place recognition.
